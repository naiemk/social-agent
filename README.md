Let's design and write a social media agent as follows:

X (twitter) platform:
- Log into X using UN/PW
- Search for relevant content given search terms
- Filter interesting tweets using an AI a kernel
- Kernel returns (interesting, like, comment, dig deeper). If comment, it will generate appropriate comment using LLM. Act according to the kernel recommendation
- In case for dig deeper, read the comments, check relevancy (using kernel) and act accordingly

This can be scheduled to run multiple times a day.

Which programming tech stack is best to use, regarding availability of robust API for X/twitter. Possibility of adding instagram in future.

Search for the best tools or libraries so that we can simplify this task as much as possible. Consider agent platforms, in addition to social media tooling.

We want to run everything on a single machine. Even my laptop. Also how can I work with twitter without paying mothly fees

Stack at a glance

Agent orchestration: Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) — model-agnostic, local-first, supports custom agents and multi-agent systems. Run everything locally during dev; wire to Gemini or OpenAI at runtime.

LLMs:

Gemini via ADK’s Gemini client.

OpenAI via ADK’s model-agnostic adapters (or a trivial custom adapter). 
Google GitHub

X (Twitter) API: Official X API v2 (OAuth 2.0). Use Tweepy or plain HTTP for: search recent tweets, like, reply, fetch conversation. (Free tier is very limited: ~100 reads / 500 writes per month; Basic ~$200/mo ≈ 15k reads / 50k writes.) 
docs.x.com

Compliance: Don’t script website logins/scrape to dodge fees—X’s terms & automation rules prohibit non-API automation/scraping and can lead to suspension.

Instagram (later): Instagram Graph API (Business/Creator accounts only) for reading comments, posting, and replies—avoid “private API” libraries. 
GitHub

Scheduling: APScheduler (Python) to run N times/day with jitter and rate-budgeting.

Local storage: SQLite (actions ledger, seen tweets, rate counters).

Extras: sentence-transformers for fast semantic ranking; pydantic for schema’d decisions; tenacity for retry/backoff.

ADK system design (maps to your flow)

Agents (ADK):

SearchAgent – wraps X Recent Search, dedupes, enriches with basic stats.

KernelAgent – ranks with embeddings, asks LLM for a structured decision:
{"decision":"interesting|like|comment|dig_deeper","comment": "...", "confidence": 0..1}

ActionAgent – executes like/reply; respects safety budgets and X rate limits.

ThreadAgent (invoked on “dig_deeper”) – pulls replies/quotes for a tweet, re-scores via KernelAgent, and may reply within a sub-thread.

Supervisor – a tiny ADK CustomAgent that orchestrates: search → kernel → (act | dig deeper), logs outcomes, and schedules follow-ups. (ADK’s BaseAgent + custom control flow is the right primitive here.) 
Google GitHub

Why ADK here? It supports explicit control-flow (Sequential/Loop or fully custom), plus multi-agent composition if you want to split concerns. You can run the dev UI locally while iterating.

Minimal ADK wiring (what you’ll actually code)

Below is a compact blueprint (file/module layout + key responsibilities). I’m keeping snippets short; you can drop them into an ADK project created from the quickstart.

  config.py               # model choice (gemini/openai), keys, thresholds, rate budgets
  models/
    adapters.py           # ADK model adapters (Gemini/OpenAI)

    x_client.py           # Tweepy / HTTP calls: search, like, reply, conversation
    ig_client.py          # (later) Instagram Graph calls

    ranker.py             # embeddings prefilter (sentence-transformers)

  agents/
    search_agent.py       # ADK BaseAgent wrapper around x_client.search()
    kernel_agent.py       # ADK BaseAgent → calls ranker + decider
    action_agent.py       # ADK BaseAgent → like/reply with safety checks
    thread_agent.py       # pulls replies/quotes; re-run kernel; optional reply
    supervisor.py         # CustomAgent to coordinate the loop
  scheduler.py            # APScheduler jobs with jitter + rate backoff
  storage.py              # sqlite (seen tweets, action log, budgets)


Model adapters (Gemini/OpenAI) in ADK
ADK is model-agnostic; you can point it at Gemini or plug in OpenAI with a small adapter. See the official docs/quickstarts and samples; they show local runs and multi-tool agents.

Supervisor (pseudo-flow):

# Pseudocode – ADK CustomAgent-style control loop
def run_cycle(topic_terms):
    tweets = search_agent.run(topic_terms)
    top = kernel_agent.score_and_label(tweets)
    for t in top:
        if t.decision == "like": action_agent.like(t.id)
        elif t.decision == "comment": action_agent.reply(t.id, t.comment)
        elif t.decision == "dig_deeper":
            replies = thread_agent.pull_and_rank(t.id)
            for r in replies.selected:
                action_agent.reply(r.id, r.comment)
        # else: interesting (log only)


Scheduling on one machine

Use APScheduler cron-style jobs, e.g., 0 9,12,15,18,21 * * * with ±random jitter to look human and to spread reads/writes.

Enforce daily/weekly action caps to stay well within X policies and rate limits (e.g., max 20 replies/day, backoff on HTTP 429).

During dev, run via ADK’s local UI/CLI.
